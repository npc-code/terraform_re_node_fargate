# toy_terraform_flask_deployment

A simple POC for working with AWS via Terraform.  Currently this will only work with a flask application running within docker, but further changes will make this more modular. This project will create:
- a vpc with 2 public and 2 private subnets across 2 azs
- an internet gateway and nat gateway for public and private subnet routes
- security groups for the alb and the fargate cluster
- appropriate IAM roles
- an alb, currently serving only http traffic
- a fargate cluster
- a codepipeline that uses codebuild to build the container and push to the created ecr, and then deploy the latest build to the fargate cluster

After the project is launched, going forward, commits made to the targeted repo will be automatically deployed on a successful build.

## Requirements
- AWS account 
- An IAM profile in the account with the necessary permissions
- Terraform
- A github repo to use as your target repository
- oauth token created on github with access to your target repository
- route53 public domain (further work will make this optional in child modules, but given the ease of use/cost, I would encourage having one)

## Dependencies
- https://github.com/npc-code/toy_ecs_code_pipeline
- https://github.com/npc-code/toy_terraform_code_pipeline
- https://github.com/npc-code/toy_terraform_network

## Installation
- Pull down the project, change into project directory, and execute: terraform init
- Create a workspace: terraform workspace new dev
- Create a variable file that will correspond to your workspace name: touch dev.tfvars
- Populate dev.tfvars with the necessary values

## Example .tfvar file
```hcl
region         = "us-east-2"
prefix         = "dev"
vpc_cidr       = "10.1.0.0/16"
oauth_token    = "your_token_here"
profile        = "your_iam_profile_name"
git_repository = { owner = "your_github_handle", name = "your_repo_name", branch = "main" }
```


## Use
- Execute: terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
- Assuming no errors, execute: terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
- drink coffee
- at end of execution, the DNS for the alb is displayed, navigate to this endpoint to access your app running in Fargate behind an alb.
- when finished, execute: terraform destroy -var-file=dev.tfvars.  THIS WILL DESTROY ALL RESOURCES CREATED BY THIS PROJECT.  

## DISCLAIMER
- some of the deployed resources will incur charges to your AWS account if you do not destroy your resources when finished.  I take no responsibility for charges incurred.
